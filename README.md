# Smile detector

A very simple implementation of python and opencv to detect faces and smiles in a frame or web cam.

## To try:

-   Install opencv if you haven't already

```
pip install opencv
```

Or if you have installed it in your virtual environment, then open it using,

```
conda activate <virtual_env_name>
```

-   Run the python script

```
python smile-detect.py
```

Press 'q' to stop recording and quit the program.
